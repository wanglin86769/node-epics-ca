These shared libraries were built using

Epics Base 3.16.2 on Centos 6.9 with gcc 4.4.7, glibc 2.12

and configure Epics to cross-compile for linux-86 host target
in configure/CONFIG_SITE.

Readline support was turned off by setting
   COMMANDLINE_LIBRARY =

in
   CONFIG_SITE.Common.linux-x86


The patchelf utility (from Anaconda Python) was used to make the shared
libraries portable with the following commands:

  mv libCom.so libComPYEPICS.so
  patchelf --set-soname libca.so libca.so
  patchelf --set-soname libComPYEPICS.so libComPYEPICS.so
  patchelf --set-rpath '$ORIGIN' libca.so
  patchelf --set-rpath '$ORIGIN' libComPYEPICS.so
  patchelf --replace-needed libCom.so.3.16.2 libComPYEPICS.so libca.so
