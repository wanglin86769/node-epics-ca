These shared libraries were built using

Epics Base 3.16.2 on Raspbian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch) with
gcc (Raspbian 6.3.0-18+rpi1) 6.3.0 20170516

The patchelf utility (from Anaconda Python) was used to make the shared
libraries portable with the following commands:

  mv libCom.so libComPYEPICS.so
  patchelf --set-soname libca.so libca.so
  patchelf --set-soname libComPYEPICS.so libComPYEPICS.so
  patchelf --set-rpath '$ORIGIN' libca.so
  patchelf --set-rpath '$ORIGIN' libComPYEPICS.so
  patchelf --replace-needed libCom.so.3.16.2 libComPYEPICS.so libca.so
  patchelf --replace-needed libCom.so libComPYEPICS.so libca.so
